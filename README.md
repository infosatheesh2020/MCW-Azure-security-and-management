Contoso Holdings is a multi-national holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, CA that owns 48 manufacturing companies located in North America, Europe, and Asia. 

In this workshop, you will help Contoso Holdings design and implement the systems to manage their Azure infrastructure at scale.  Per Roberto Milian, VP of Development and IT Operations, "Contoso's primary concern is how to best deploy, test, manage, monitor, patch, secure and troubleshoot these applications in Azure IaaS.”

## Target audience
-	Infrastructure Architect
-	IT Professional

## Abstract

### Workshop
In this workshop you will learn to design solutions using Azure’s native security and management services. With increasing number of resources running in the cloud, enterprises will need to apply the right capabilities to secure and well manage their data and resources.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and implement security and management solutions in Azure including inventory tracking and management, application performance monitoring , preventative maintenance and application and security alerting.

### Hands-on lab
In this hands-on lab, you will first deploy a simple web application and database to Azure IaaS VMs, using a Resource Manager Template and Azure Automation DSC. You will then configure a range of infrastructure management capabilities on this deployment, including Update Management, Security Center, Service Map, Change Tracking and Application Insights. You will use Azure Monitor to configure application alerts and send, via both email and mobile application notifications. You will also learn how to further investigate infrastructure status using Log Analytics queries. In doing so, you will learn both how to deploy these solutions and be introduced to their capabilities.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design, implement and use a wide range of infrastructure management systems in Azure.

NOTE: The setup tasks should be completed in advance of the hands-on lab to save deployment time.
